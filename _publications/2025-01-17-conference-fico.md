Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely utilized
across industries, necessitating robust security measures. Radio
Frequency (RF) fingerprinting based UAV identification can en-
hance UAV authentication and authorization by identifying unique
RF signals, bypassing vulnerabilities of software-based methods.
However, existing methods often rely on single-domain signal
sources, limiting their robustness by environmental factors such as
distance, interference, and multi-path propagation. To address the
challenges of UAV identification, we propose a novel lightweight
two-step learning-to-learn classification approach, FiCo, which
integrates multiple data sources from diverse domains, including
mechanical vibration and 5G communications. In the first step,
we employ two Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models to
separately analyze communication and vibration data from UAVs.
In the second step, a Logistic Regression meta-network is utilized
to jointly learn from the predictions of these two XGBoost models.
Experimental results show that the FiCo method boosts the AUC
to 0.9792 and the accuracy to 92.59%. This represents a 2%
accuracy increase over the Data Combined method and it improves
accuracy by 9.3% with communication data alone and by 5.6%
with vibration data alone, raising the AUC by 0.088 and 0.029,
respectively. This approach reduces computational complexity and
requires fewer training samples, enabling faster and more agile
UAV identification in practice.
