excerpt: 'The reliability of 5G systems and their applications in a complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environment requires rigorous testing and real-time detection for system vulnerabilities and unintended emergent behaviors. In this paper, fuzz testing is performed on 5G systems by randomly injecting and permuting control commands into the system under test (SUT) of the 5G radio resource control (RRC) authentication and authorization process, emulating Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks to trigger potential vulnerabilities and unintended behaviors.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
